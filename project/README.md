## Assignment Requirements

#### Technical Tasks
The following technical tasks should be underdataken:

* Preprocessing (except if obviously unnecessary)
* Descriptive statistics
* Appropriate visualization
* Appropriate validation of results

The following algorithm should be implemented:

* Frequent pattern mining (association mining, sequence pattern mining etc.)
* Clustering
* Supervised learning (classification/prediction)

#### Report Details

The report should answer the following questions:

* What knowledge are you trying to extract from what data?
* What methods will you be using?
* Why did you choose this data set and this data?
* How do the algorithms work? (Only a brief overview necessary.)
* How did you extract, stor and manage the data?
* Which parameters were used with the algorithms? Did you do any tuning? Why/why not?
* How good are the results, and how valid? What do they really show? (Remember to compare with mode/mean prediction as a baseline, i.e. ZeroR)
* If applicable (in most cases it is), what is the societal impact and what are the privacy aspects of your work?
* Why did it work / did it not work?
